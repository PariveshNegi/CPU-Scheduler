## Overview

The **CPU Scheduling Simulator** is an interactive, browser-based visualization tool that demonstrates the operation of core CPU scheduling algorithms. Designed for educational purposes, it helps users understand and compare how different algorithms schedule processes in a multitasking environment.

## Features

- **Add Process:** Users can input process details such as ID, arrival time, and burst time.
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:** Supports FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin algorithms.
- **Visual Gantt Chart:** Dynamically shows how processes are scheduled over time.
- **Real-Time Calculations:** Displays average waiting time, turnaround time, and throughput.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, dark-themed interface designed for desktops and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **No Backend Needed:** All logic and visualization are handled client-side.  
- **Data Persistence:** All processes are stored temporarily in memory during runtime.

## Getting Started

➡️ **Live Demo:** [Replace this with actual GitHub Pages link if deployed](#)

## Usage

- **Add a Process:** Enter `Process ID`, `Arrival Time`, and `Burst Time` in the input form and click **Add Process**.
- **Choose Algorithm:** Select any scheduling algorithm from the options (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority, Round Robin).
- **Time Quantum (for Round Robin):** Specify a time slice if using Round Robin.
- **Calculate:** Click **Calculate Schedule** to see results and Gantt Chart.
- **Clear:** Use the **Clear All** button to reset the process table and results.
